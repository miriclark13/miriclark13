## Hi! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ–¤
  ### BioðŸ«¶
  <p>Hello there! My name is Mirianna, and I am currently studying at ASU! I am *technically* majoring in Sustainabiliy, however, I have always wanted to learn how to code, so I am taking advantage of the     opportunity to learn! I'd like to make a career out of coding, and if I had my ideal choice, I would become a game developer! I really love video games and I think it would be incredible to impact others in the same way that some video games have impacted me.</p>

  <p>I don't have much experience in coding, besides what I have tried to teach myself before this class. I used HTML to try and create a text-based game, so that is pretty much the extent of my experience. However, I am very excited to learn!</p>
